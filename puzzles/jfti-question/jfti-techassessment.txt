Question 1
Technical writing is an important skill to have in the analytics and computer programming industry for many reasons.

Before we introduce our coding assessment, please explain why YOU think technical writing is important, specifically as it pertains to your role as a software developer, analyst, etc.?


Question 2
***PART 1: CODING ASSESSMENT***

PLEASE COMPLETE IN C++

Create a program that accepts an integer 'n' as an argument and executes the fizz buzz task as follows: 
    Starting at 1 and ending 'n' print the following on each line 
	    If the number divisible by only 3, the word Fizz should be printed.
		If the number divisible by only 5, the word Buzz should be printed.
		If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, FizzBuzz should be printed.
		otherwise print the number. 

Limitations:

1) You must use at least 3 different classes.
2) You must use inheritance and virtual functions.
3) Each class can only print one case (i.e. one class prints Fizz, one prints Buzz, and one prints the number)
4) The base class must have a function that accepts an integer and that function should execute the task.
5) In the main function of the program you must instantiate a base class object with an inherited class.

The code below is an idea to use as a framework:

void main(int argc, char argv)
{
int n = // put argument 2 here;
BaseClass* b = new InheritedClass;
b.printSolution(n)
}

***PART 2: TECHNICAL WRITING ASSESSMENT***

Below your code, and once completed, please write a short paragraph (no more than 8 sentences) explaining the program you just created. 
Keep in mind that you need to illustrate YOUR code and how it functions, as opposed to restating the prompt you were assigned. 
As a general rule: your goal is to elaborate on your code well enough to ensure it can be followed by someone unfamiliar with the scope of the project.

NOTE: Comment-out your technical writing piece so it doesn't get confused with the program you just created.
